## The Project
### Motivation
This Repository contains the code for the psychiatric medication checker that was built during the PRA3006: Programming in the Life Sciences course of the academic year 2022-2023. 

The Tool aims to show how different webservices can be combined to provide an accessible resource which may help patients suffering from simultaneous mental disorders check the interactions  and potentially the overlap between the medications used as treatment. This tool does not claim to replace any professional medical advice, simply to show the potential for the usage of tools such as this.
