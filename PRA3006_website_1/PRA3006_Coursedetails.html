    <p>PRA3006 stands for <em>Programming in the Life Sciences</em>.</p>
    <p>PRA3006 is a course offered by the Maastricht Science Program (MSP). It is a 3000lvl course (highest level available at MSP) that expands on students knowledge in programming (SPARQL, d3.js, javascript, html, css) and their biological knowledge (since we need to answer a biology-related question using the aforementioned languages).</p>
